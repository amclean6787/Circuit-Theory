## General Info
This repository contains all of the source code and input and output files associated with the Circuit Theory analysis carried out for the 'Beyond Least Cost Paths: Circuit Theory, Maritime Mobility and Patterns of Urbanism in the Roman Adriatic' paper submitted to the Journal of Archaeological Science.

## Setup
The setup for the Circuit theory analysis was conducted in R, the CT analysis itself in Julia, and the processing of the outputs again in R. R and Julia are all that are required to reproduce this analysis.

## Author and Contact
This repository was created by Andrew McLean, in order to provide access to source code and supplementary data.
